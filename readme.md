# Detect And Aware
I have build this project while learning openCV.<br>
The need of this project is to stop the damages,in farm, caused by animals and birds in time.<br>
As soon as the camera sees the bird entering the farm it texts the farmer about it.
___
## Things used
* Nexmo(for sending messages)
* OpenCV(for identifiying the birds)
* Python(for writing the code)
___
I have tested the code on the video which is icluded in this repo and it works great.
